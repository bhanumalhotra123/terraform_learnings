What is terraform?

Hashicorp tools: terraform, vault, packer etc

Infrastructure as code(In aws = cloudformation)

Terraform takes the configuration file(*.tf) and makes the api calls on behalf of us to the cloud provider.



HCL(Hashicorp Configuration Language)

Why can't hashicorp use languages like yaml or yaml for configuration files? Why do they have HCL?

Mainly Hashicorp started it for terraform and later extended to other projects like packer etc.
One of the reason for this is in case of json you can't add a comment, in HCL you can.




How terraform extends its functionallity as you download it with just a single binary ? Plugins

https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers

Terraform provides alot of provides: kubernetes, aws, alibaba cloud.

They even have the provider for random(let us say you want to create a S3 bucket and we know S3 bucket name has to be unique, we can use this for random provider for it instead of writing random name by ourselves)



Miss conception about terraform: the code can be used anywhere.

Say you are working with AWS --> VPC and now you want to shift to another.

Now all the api's are different for say google cloud. So you need to change the name of provider, name of resource




# Define the provider (AWS in this case)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # You can change the region to your desired region
}

# Define the AWS EC2 instance resource
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"               # Instance type (change as needed)
}

# Output the public IP address of the EC2 instance
output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
