terraform init
==============


This is the first command you use once you are done writing your terraform code.



# Define the provider (AWS in this case)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # You can change the region to your desired region
}

# Define the AWS EC2 instance resource
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"               # Instance type (change as needed)
}

# Output the public IP address of the EC2 instance
output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}

Once you do terraform init

It downloads aws plugin and place it in local directory.

Where is this local directory?

.terraform is the location 

Terraform downloads the plugin in .terraform and using this plugin to make the api calls.

What is the use of downloaded plugin?

It helps terraform understand things like:

what is aws?
what is ec2?
what is a security group?
what is a nacl? 
etc...............


In production we don't provide plugins like the way we did in this case.


In production we seperately create a file like terraform.tf so that everyone gets the same version of the plugins.



What is the use of .terraform.lock.hcl?

Whever harshicorp upgrades the version of plugin they make sure they have the backward compatibility.
Plugin version error:
Out of the blue if someone tries to run the code with different version of a plugin than which is mentioned in lock file terraform checks in lock file and the run command fails.



Is there a way we can check if versions are correct before running the script in prod?

Always check in terraform registry for latest version of plugins and test them in pre-prod environments.


When you run terraform init, it checks the main.tf provider and installs the plugin.
If provider is not mentioned it will check the resource and will try to locate the plugin for that. 
And it downloads always the latest plugins.


terraform init checks all the *.tf 

So that is how it is able to look into terraform.tf file as well as main.tf and more.
