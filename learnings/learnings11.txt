terraform fmt

This help us in formating the file.

terraform fmt --diff 

to see how it is formating the file

terraform doesn't care about spaces, but for our clarity we want code to be properly indented

when we are using --diff we are generally doing this in development environments

moreover this just fixes the indentation in local memory

For production, flags like --write=false are used in the pipelines as it fails the code and don't let it pass to the next stage if there is identation error.
